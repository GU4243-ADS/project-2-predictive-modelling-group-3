To Extract Features from SIFT

Make sure to copy the train-features folder to <../data/train-features>

```{r}
features_all = list()
keypoints_all = list()

sift_feature_dir <- "../data/train-features/" # This will be modified for different data sets.

for (i in 1:2000){
  file = sprintf("pet%i.jpg.sift.RData", i)
  file_path = paste0(sift_feature_dir,file)
  load(file_path)
  features_all[[i]] = features
  keypoints_all[[i]] = keypoints
}
```

Now there should be a features_all, and keypoints_all, both length 2000 lists. pet1.jpg.sift corrosponds to features_all[1], etc.
