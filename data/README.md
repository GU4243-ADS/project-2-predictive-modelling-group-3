# Project 2: Predictive Modelling

### Data folder

The data directory contains the image data used in the analysis. The pets folder normally contains both the training and testing sets of thousands of dog and cat images, however, due to Github storage space these images are not kept online. SIFT features were provided as data in this directory as well. This is treated as read only.
